1. No transitive dependenicies between NET Frameworks and Standard so 
System.ServiceModel.Primitives and System.ServiceModel.Http (used by AdminkaV1.LoggingDom.WcfClient) where referenced manually

2. this project contains tool required for coverage test: opencover, reportgenerator, coveralls 
(coveralls should be limited to version 0.7.0 since mangagin ver 1 from dotnet install doesn't work for me)
