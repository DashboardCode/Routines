FOR CORE 2

1. Proxy was generated using Microsoft WCF Web Service Reference Provider ver 0.5.10808.800
	https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WCFCORETEAM.VisualStudioWCFConnectedService  
2. AdminkaV1 were referenced as "file" since VS2017 only then its types can be reused (vitaly important)

csproj:
  <ItemGroup">
    <Reference Include="DashboardCode.AdminkaV1">
      <HintPath>..\Abstractions\bin\Debug\netstandard2.0\DashboardCode.AdminkaV1.dll</HintPath>
      <Private>false</Private>
    </Reference>
  </ItemGroup>

2b. Keep "Copy Local" property for AdminakV1.Abstractions.dll  off


FOR CORE 3 
1. Type resuing doesn't work for "multiple" target destiantion. Conditionals in csproj doesn't help - this is Service Provider Limitation (informs with an error)
2. Only one way edit after references after generation:
   To simplifyEdit ConnectedService.json to add something like this

    "namespaceMappings": [
      "http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/DashboardCode.AdminkaV1.LoggingDom, DashboardCode.AdminkaV1.LoggingDom",
      "*, TraceServiceReference"
    ],
