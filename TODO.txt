0. Add Many-to-Many test tables to TestDom and add Storage tests for them (improove coverage)
0b. Nuget platform.

FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Catch logs to DB.
2. Search for correlation token.
3. IAuthenticationService to wcf. 

SERVER SIDE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Set Assembly.cs AssemblyCompany property
3. Inline includables goes to github as separated "one file" project
3b. Circular javascript serializer goes to github as "one file" project
4. Vse release on github
5. Publish routines, routines.storage.efcore on NUGET.
6. Create samples https://dotnetfiddle.net/
7. Write article about includes.

SERVER SIDE (OTHER)

7. how to generate DTO classes.
   generate typescripts with T4 like https://www.nuget.org/packages/TypeLite do but with includes;
   that means all helper functions should be placed into Vse.Routines.dll; 
		since we have "includes" it should be possible (dictionaries? indent algorithm?)
   
7b. how to use DTO with automapper, why not to generate dto with mpa function?

	Choose "c# DTO generator" there is number of them
		1b)  it should generates map methods also
		1b)  or be "integrated" with automapper
	
	Why: 
	    * size (?) - I'm not sure is this possible
	    * avoid circular references (?) - so the generator should "guarantee" that DTO would not have them
	
	Important:
		* DTO's should be part of Abstraction assembly to be shared between various services 



8. Complex routine (1) authentication 2) through TempData); check async.
9. UserContext Caching.
10. Bufferize NLog Logging (create custom formater that can process array of events).

Follow EFCore development: complextypes (versioned); many-to-many; columns order.
